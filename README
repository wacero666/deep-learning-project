To run the code, you need to download the Million Song dataset and LastFm datasets.

Note that we use the full dataset from both sources, which may be easy to run on AWS. 



[data_preparation]
Where we transform image to numpy array, and will generate train_set_score.npy and test_set_score.npy for running the model.
 |
 ->[MSD_to_Spectrogram]
    Where we turn audio features to spectrogram representation of each song. 
	|
	-> [MatlabSrc] is a source code from Million Song Dataset, where it helps us to 	   generate a spectrogram image.  


[model]
cnn_final_model.py is used to run on song pairs with balanced similarity score 
cnn_imbalanced.ipynb is used to run on song pairs with imbalanced similarity score
lstm_cnn_model.py is our initial model that used cnn and lstm
